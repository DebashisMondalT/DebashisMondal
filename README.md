# Java Problem Solving Project

This Java project includes solutions to a series of programming problems focused on arithmetic operations, series generation, and working with collections such as lists and maps.

## 🧩 Problem List

### ✅ Problem 1: Simple Calculator
Create a Proble_1 class that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

- **Inputs**: `double a`, `double b`, `String operation`
- **Operations Supported**: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`

---

### ✅ Problem 2: Generate Odd Number Series (Fixed Count)
Generate a list of the first `a` odd numbers.

- **Input**: `int a`
- **Output**: Series like `1`, `1, 3`, `1, 3, 5`, etc.

---

### ✅ Problem 3: Conditional Odd Number Series
Similar to Problem 2, but:
- If `a` is **even**, generate the first `a - 1` odd numbers.
- If `a` is **odd**, generate the first `a` odd numbers.

---

### ✅ Problem 4: Count Multiples of 1 to 9
Given a list of integers, count how many elements are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.

- **Input**: User-defined list of integers
- **Output**: Map showing count of multiples `{1=11, 2=8, ..., 9=1}`

---


### 💻 Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
- Command-line (or terminal) access
